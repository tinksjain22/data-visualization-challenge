### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

  Mouse ID: Unique identifier for each mouse.
  
  Timepoint: The time in days at which measurements were taken.
  
  Tumor Volume (mm3): The volume of the tumor measured in cubic millimeters.
  
  Metastatic Sites: Number of metastatic sites observed.
  
  Drug Regimen: The drug treatment administered to the mouse.
  
  Sex: The sex of the mouse.
  
  Age_months: The age of the mouse in months.
  
  Weight (g): The weight of the mouse in grams.

### Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Identifying and removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of data, summarizing key statistics, and visualizing relationships between variables.

Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to determine the significance of observed differences in tumor volumes and metastatic sites among the different drug regimens.

Visualization: Creating plots to illustrate the findings, such as box plots, scatter plots, and survival curves.

Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and providing insights into the effectiveness of the various drug regimens.
